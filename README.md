# libbluray
A C# port of the [libbluray library](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/libbluray) created by VideoLAN.

Unit tests were created by porting [bluray_info](https://github.com/beandog/bluray_info/tree/1.14) and comparing the results to a json file generated by the original C++ program.

For this port I try to keep the public interface the same and simply update the code to use C# types and styles.
